# 🎯 DO THIS NOW - SIMPLE 4-STEP GUIDE

## The Error You Got:
```
ERROR: relation "organizations" does not exist
```

## The Fix (5 Minutes):

---

### ✅ **STEP 1** - Check if tables exist

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bmdzerzampxetxmpmihv/sql

Run this:
```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'organization';
```

**If you see "organization" → Skip to STEP 3**
**If you see "no rows" → Continue to STEP 2**

---

### ✅ **STEP 2** - Create tables (if needed)

Open: `supabase-schema.sql`
Copy entire file → Paste in SQL Editor → Click Run

⏱️ Takes ~15 seconds

---

### ✅ **STEP 3** - Setup organization & fixes

Run these 2 scripts in order:

**First:**
Open: `supabase-pre-flight-fixes.sql`
Copy → Paste → Run

**Second:**
Open: `setup-after-schema.sql`
Copy → Paste → Run

Should see: "DATABASE SETUP COMPLETE"

---

### ✅ **STEP 4** - Load your events

Open: `load-mikilele-data.sql`

**IMPORTANT**: Find line 54 with `'YOUR_USER_ID'`

Replace with your actual user ID from:
Supabase → Authentication → Users → Copy your UUID

Then: Copy full file → Paste → Run

⏱️ Takes ~5 seconds

---

## ✅ Done!

Test it worked:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as events FROM events;
SELECT COUNT(*) as passes FROM pass_types;
```

Should see:
- events: 8
- passes: 4

## 🌐 Then Test Website
